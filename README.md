# Student-Performance-Prediction
Predict student performance risk before exams using early-available background/support indicators (no score leakage), to support targeted interventions.

Problem: Predict a student’s expected average score BEFORE exams using only early-available background/support indicators:
gender, race_ethnicity, parental_level_of_education, lunch, test_preparation_course

Purpose: early-risk identification → target support (tutoring, meal/resource support, prep programs).

Important: avoid leakage (do NOT use math_score, reading_score, writing_score, total_score, average as features).
